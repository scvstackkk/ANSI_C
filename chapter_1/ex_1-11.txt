Testing should be done to verify the various boundary conditions are caught in the program's execution. Also, general case input should be tested for common functionality.


note: use Ctrl+D to exit stdin.

Edge case sample tests:


"" -> should return 0 0 0
" " -> should return 0 0 1
" a " -> should return 0 1 3 
"fr'\t'ank'\n'" -> should return 0 1 13


General case sample tests:

"hello" -> should return 0 1 5
"hello  world" -> should return 0 2 11
"hello
world" -> (using an enter for \n, no spaces) 1 2 11
